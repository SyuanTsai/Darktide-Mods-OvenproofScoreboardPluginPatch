# 1.13.7 - 2026-08-12
## New
- Added new damage type from Skitarii force field and discharge, `cryptic_arc_shock_damage`: Ranged
- Updated `zh-cn` localization. Thanks DingXiang223!
- Updated `zh-tw` localization. Thanks SyuanTsai!
## Changed
- Hid row categorization options. These didn't do anything yet.
- Refactored data tables for faster access
    - Before, they were all arrays, and finding if something was a value in it was O(n)
    - Now, the target of the search is the key, so searches can be done in O(1)
    - Since these searches happen every single time an enemy was hit/killed (and even every frame in the case of health checks), this should improve performance a bit
    - Plus, it makes it easier to swap things in and out
- Refactored Scoreboard row access to use index instead of `ipairs` per [Fatshark's Lua optimization recommendations](https://dmf-docs.darkti.de/#/Fatshark-%E2%80%90-Lua-Optimizing-Guide?id=prefer-numeric-for-loops-over-ipairs-to-iterate-over-arrays) for improved performance
- Changed `replace_value_within_row_table` to support using a new value instead of nil. Nothing changes functionally currently; this is for the future.

# 2026-06-26
v1.13.6
- Added Integrated Refraction Emitter's Voltaic Resistance (`force_field_chain_jump_damage`): Blitz, fallback to Ranged

# 2026-06-25

- Fixed Servo Skull damage not being caught by the Companion damage row, when that's enabled
    - Added these damage types to companion
        - `default_companion_servo_skull_lasgun_killshot`
        - `improved_companion_servo_skull_lasgun_killshot`
        - `companion_servo_skull_flamer`
    - Moved the companion damage check to before ranged damage, since this would count both
- Added Arc Maul lightning (`chain_lightning_killing_blow`): melee. I fully expect this to become a problem in the future
- Fixed incorrect mod name being used in the instructions to disable error messages
- Removed the debug message I forgot about lol

# 2026-06-25

    - `renegade_vanguard`
- Added poxburster shove damage (when it's inactive but then gets pushed, `poxwalker_bomber_instakill`) to environmental damage

# 2026-06-20
v1.12.0
Skitussy

I fully expect more things to be necessary but we know about this one, at least.
- Added Skitarii phosphor burn to burning

...

# 2025-12-28
v1.9.2

- Missing tox damage type from horde spreading (`horde_mode_self_propagating_toxin`)

# 2025-12-07
v1.9.1

- Added machine translations from Sai
- Added comments to help translators

# 2025-12-07
v1.9.0

- Split grenade pickup messages from ammo pickup messages
    - Now there's two settings for pickups
    - one each, for grenades and ammo
- Added `zh-tw` localizations from SyuanTsai. Thank you!

# 2025-12-07
v1.8.1

- Added AML support
    - Load order with Scoreboard doesn't matter
    - What does matter is that it's present

# 2025-12-07
v1.8.0

- Added mod options to optionally track other states as disabled
    - Originally these were disabled by mod author preference
        - Catapulted (new): when hit by big knockback and you're flinging your arms about
        - Warp Grabbed: pretty sure this is the Daemonhost
        - Charged by Mutant
    - States tracker doesn't seem to run in the Psykhanium/SoloPlay, so this is a pain in the ass to test >_>
- Added option to have separate Blitz damage tracked (thanks Syllogism!)
    - Included options to include them for weakspot rate and crit rate calculations, respectively
        - These are kind of janky (my fault)
        - ## When disabled, they are still present but invisible, so the two columns are off center
        - Can't just remove the rows because reinserting them would not preserve the row order
    - **Do not do this mid-match! Toggle these options before starting a match**
        - This includes the Psykhanium
        - Exit and reenter to test
    - Thanks to Syllogism for doing the legwork in digging through the damage types for blitzes and integrating it into the damage calculations
- Added option to condense Companion Damage into another row
    - By default, it's still its own row
    - Otherwise, it'll be counted towards Melee/Ranged/Blitz
    - If set to Blitz but there's no visible Blitz row, there will be a warning
        - This warning can be toggled off in the Mod Options
        - Warning is in Chat and Notification
    - Lets you hide the Companion row regardless of the above
        - So you can have companion damage in its own thing but hidden
        - In case you want to have Blitz but not Companion
- Moved some mod options around for organization
    - explosion hitrate settings are in their own category
    - this is to keep them separate from the rows warnings
- Refactored Localization helper functions to improve performance slightly
- (Dev only) Added functions for modifying rows after they've been copied into the base mod
    - Did this so you can change settings without restarting the game or reloading mods
    - Not recommended to totally remove things due to sorting

# 2025-12-05
v1.7.1

- Refactored the code to be more clearly split up
    - data types and scoreboard rows put into their own files
    - these files are loaded by the main logic before they're used
    - also made local copies of references to these to avoid the global table lookup every time
        - mainly for the enemy types and attack types
        - but it covers the ammo and disabled stuff too
- Added debug messages for missing enemy breeds
    - added "skip" section for intentionally not categorized enemies
        - it's just the two ritualists at the moment
        - they are internally classified as `ritualist` instead of lessers or whatever, and I don't think it's justified to create a whole new row for this (considering how many there already are)
    - this is like the damage types report. when there's an unrecognized enemy, it'll print a message saying what it is

# 2025-12-02
v1.7.0

No Man's Land - Hive Scum

- Fixed crash from ammo values
    - `current_ammunition_clip` and `max_ammunition_clip` are now table returns
- Added Toxin damage row
- Added Hive Scum missile launcher backblast to ranged damage `missile_launcher_knockback`
- Refactored (devs only)
    - Uncategorized types, error message
        - put into function
        - less copy pasted code
    - Local references for global functions
        - for less overhead
        - these get called a looot
    - Reused localizations are now stored in variables

# 2025-10-01
v1.6.1

- Fixed typo for explosions affecting melee hitrate in localization
- Some localizations Sai added

# 2025-09-26
v1.6.0

- Added toggles for explosions affecting hitrates
    - One for ranged and one for melee, both defaulted to `true` to be consistent with the original settings
    - So it doesn't artificially deflate your crit/weakspot rate
        - I don't think explosions can crit
        - There are settings for the server to override explosions to not do crits
        - in `scripts/extension_systems/weapon/actions/action_melee_explosive` there's a check to set `is_critical_strike = false` every time
    - Created a helper function to check for it
        - Checks if user wants this to not happen
        - Checks if the end of the damage type ends in "explosion"
            - in `scripts/settings/equipment/weapon_templates/bolt_pistols/settings_templates/boltpistole_damage_profile_templates`
            - there is an entry `damage_templates.boltpistol_stop_explosion`
            - this naming scheme is consistent with other bolter explosions
            - hopefully this doesn't mess up later :)

# 2025-09-25
v1.5.2

- `game_mode` instead of `game_mode_manager`
- I had it like this before but decided to change it for no reason :)

# 2025-09-24
v1.5.1

- Fixed Havoc manager location change, causing the error on map change (fr this time??)
- It got moved to havoc_extension from `Managers.state.game_mode_manager():extension("havoc")`
    - looks like this new one also doubles as the check for if you're on havoc or not
    - settings table was the same afaik

# 2025-09-23: Bound by Duty
v1.5.0

- Added Scab Plasma Gunner
- Fixed Havoc manager location change, causing the error on map change (thanks Wobin and Vatinas)

# 2025-08-UNRELEASED
v1.4.1

MOVED TO BRANCH BECAUSE IT DIDN'T WORK LOL

- Refactored code to manage blank rows on the Scoreboard, `manage_blank_rows()`
    - What it actually does is make sure that blank values are actually blank, instead of "lol" (which is what the base Scoreboard does)
    - Before, the logic to check if this needed to be done was being executed **literally every game tick**
    - This *needs* to be done:
        - Before the Scoreboard is shown
        - After a new player joins
    - Now, I trimmed it down to two main situations:
        1. Before (and while) the Scoreboard is shown in the Tactical Overlay
        2. Right at match end, on entering the end view
    - Removed from `manage_blank_rows()`:
        - Only run during matches check, `in_match` 
            - The hooks and other checks inside of it account for only working when there's players
            - Now it can work when entering the end view screen
        - Empty text per players check, `not row["data"][account_id]["text"]`
            - Initialized blank rows
            - When it ran every tick, it intercepted the scoreboard immediately when a player joined, so this check was to make that only run once that happens instead of writing blank rows every single time
            - Since blank rows won't be overwritten
    - Removed `replace_row_value("highest_single_hit", ...)` from `set_blank_rows()`
        - When it was initializing blank rows, it also set highest damage in a single hit to 0 to initialize
        - There is already a fallback in the actual counting
        - However, if a player joins without doing any damage, this won't happen
        - Moved the check to `manage_blank_rows()`
            - Has its own check
            - Before, it wouldn't happen if the first blank row was already handled

# 2025-07-26
v1.4.0

- Fixed incorrect wasted ammo check for Ammo Crates
    - stupid bitch made a typo
    - die
- Refactors
    - Helper function to check settings when there's a subwidget for havoc only
    - Helper functions to create widgets with a subwidget for havoc only
    - Standardized havoc only widget titles so I can reuse the one localization text
- Added option to track ammo crate waste only in Havoc (technically a new feature so it's 1.4.0 instead of 1.3.1, by my standards)

# 2025-07-25
v1.3.0

- Fix for Havoc crate pickups (thanks for noticing, Vatinas!)
    - Havoc modifier was being applied only to the ammo missing, not the actual pickup amount, so values were too low
        - e.g. Have 40% ammo and use crate with Havoc modifier of 85%
        - OLD: pickup was calculated as 60% * 85% = 51%
        - NEW: Pickup is 100% * 85% = 85%
    - Now calculates actual pickup amount and percentage
- Added more settings options
    - Grouped up ammo settings (messages and waste)
    - Added toggle to track ammo crate waste (defaulted to off to not have unexpected changes)
    - Added toggle to add ammo crate to total percentage of pickup
        - Added toggle to only do this in Havoc
        - Defaults to off to not have unexpected changes
- Refactored
    - Ammo pickup variables moved around to have less copied code (now that waste can be tracked for both)
    - Scoreboard mod check
        - Needs to check if Scoreboard is installed
        - Before, it was checking this... literally every single time something needed to be tracked...
        - Now I check it once on startup, when all mods load, and exit with an error message if it's not found
        - Also removed the checks for `if scoreboard then` because it's implied by having reached this far
    - Made mod version a global
        - Slightly worse performance on restart
        - Now other mods can check this mod's version, in case they rely on one of the features from a specific version onward
        - ...Nobody is going to do this
    - Moved hooks to only be executed after all mods are loaded, so they don't get executed if Scoreboard is not installed
- Logged uncategorized ammo pickup types, in case that's ever a thing
- Style
    - Moved helper functions above hooks
    - Indented breed tables and such, so my IDE can collapse them all at once
- Completely shit my pants when I saw `mod:manage_blank_rows()` was being called LITERALLY EVERY GAME TICK? BUTTER MY BUTT AND CALL ME A BISCUIT

# 2025-07-08
v1.2.5

- Localization fixes from Sai

# 2025-07-08
v1.2.4

- Added Brazilian Portuguese localization from Talesz

# 2025-07-08
v1.2.3

- Added fallback for havoc ammo modifier
    - Defaults to 1 if not found in table (low havocs don't use the values from that)
    - Added silent logging for this so I can debug later
- Made local variable for tostring for performance

# 2025-07-07
v1.2.2

- Readded the debug message suppression (how did that disappear???)
    - now also prints it silently into the log if they're suppressed
    - probably lost it when i used the versions with localizations from the nexus page
- Added `psyker_heavy_swings_shock` to ranged damage (tyvm syllogism :prayge:)
    - Put in ranged because it's electrocution on heavies from Smite sub talent and dog electrocution remote detonation (`adamant_whistle_electrocution` so I'm assuming that's what it is)
    - In `settings/buff/weapon_buff_templates.lua` they added the buff category to it, so before it was probably defaulting to melee/ranged (checked myself and thanks to syllogism for checking first)
    - `templates.adamant_whistle_electrocution.attack_type = attack_types.buff`

# 2025-07-01
v1.2.2-beta-fail

- Added check to separate shock maul electrocution and dog electrocution
    - Put `shockmaul_stun_interval_damage` into both `melee_damage_profiles` and `companion_damage_profiles`
    - Add to melee damage if it matches the damage profile AND attack type was NOT dog
    - No check needed for companion damage because it's an elseif
- nvm this was shit

# 2025-07-01
v1.2.1-beta

- Added localizations for new settings
    - I don't know who added these so I can't credit :(
    - Russian, Simplified Mandarin, and Traditional Mandarin
    - Originally these were from xsSplater, deluxghost, and SyuanTsai respectively (idk if they came back to do these new ones)

# 2025-06-27
v1.2.0-beta-branch

- Moved some units and damage types around
    - Mutator disablers (Grandfather's Gifts) from specialists to disablers. **Thanks Tunnfisk!**
    - Fix for bleed and warpfire damage counting as melee (removing buff from melee type. **thanks syllogism!**)
    - Moved `shockmaul_stun` to dog damage type, since shock maul electricity damage is less important than dog shocks (thanks for the suggestion syllogism!). Planning on a "cleaner" solution to this later
- Added ammo pickup modifiers from Havoc (pickups give less)
    - Check if mission is Havoc when starting a mission
    - If so, set the ammo modifier from the Havoc settings template
- Some code reorganizing to make it easier for me to read
- Coding style for the localizations
